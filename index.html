       <li>The Amazing cookie</li>
       <body>
INGREDIENTS

1¼cups all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled
¾cup unsweetened cocoa powder (preferably Dutch process)
1½teaspoons baking powder
¼teaspoon salt
½cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1cup light brown sugar
2 large eggs
¼cup confectioners’ sugar
DIRECTIONS

Heat oven to 350° F. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.
With an electric mixer, beat the butter and brown sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs. Reduce speed to low and gradually add the flour mixture, mixing until just incorporated.
Form the dough into balls (each equal to 1 level tablespoon). Roll the balls in the confectioners’ sugar and place on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them 2 inches apart. Bake until the cookies are firm and the tops crack, 13 to 15 minutes.
Cool slightly on the baking sheets, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
